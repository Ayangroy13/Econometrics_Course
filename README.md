# Introduction to Econometrics

[NPTEL - Online Certification](https://internalapp.nptel.ac.in/B2C/exam_form/candidate_login/candidate_scores.php?courseid=noc24-ec06)

## Course Overview

The study of econometrics attempts to quantify economic relationships, as the name would imply. It offers empirical support for abstract economic theory by utilizing economic data and statistical and mathematical techniques. Econometrics can be widely applied in various social science and pure scientific fields in addition to the field of economics. After completing the course successfully, students will be able to create an econometric model to analyze data and determine any cause-and-effect relationships in the fields of economics, finance, science, engineering, and engineering, which are their selected areas of interest. Proficiency in econometrics greatly enhances students' employment prospects.

## Course Coordinator 

Prof. Sabuj Kumar Mandal,
IIT Madras

Dr. Sabuj Kumar Mandal is currently working as an Associate Professor in the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM), Chennai. He completed his B.Sc (Economics) from the Scottish Church College Kolkata (1999-2002) and M.Sc (Economics) from the University of Calcutta with a specialization in Econometrics. He completed his doctoral degree in economics from the Institute for Social and Economic Change, Bangalore. His teaching and research interests include Applied Econometrics, Energy and Environmental Economics (efficiency analysis), Adaptation to Climate Change, Environmental regulation and Firm Performance, and Behavioral & Experimental Economics. He has several national and international publications in his credit. He was awarded Young Economist Award 2015 by the Indian Econometric Society for his contribution to quantitative economics. Recently, he has been awarded the Fulbright Nehru Academic and Professional Excellence Award 2020-21 (research category) for conducting research in the area of ‚ÄòCommunity Adaptation to Climate Change‚Äô taking Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact (SFRCC) as a model for analysis. He aims to develop an economic framework based on rational choice theory, to identify the motivating factors that determine private participation in community-based adaptation (CBA) focusing on individuals' perception of climate risk, time preference, and their adaptive capacity
